## Summary 

   The article [@shipe2019developing] explains how logistic regression is used to predict health outcomes by analyzing different patient groups and their results. It highlights the importance of collecting clean data, properly handling missing values, and choosing the best predictors for training the model. The article also describes how to evaluate how well the model works and how accurate its predictions are. To ensure the model performs reliably, it is tested on new patient data outside the original group. Overall, the model can help doctors make better decisions and improve patient care. 
   
   This second article [@joshi2021predicting] is also another health related study where now logistic regression is used to predict type two diabetes. The process is the same as the first article where they data was cleaned and handled the missing data and find the important predictors to use to create the model. I believe the most important predictors were BMI, Age of the patients and family history. The accurate of the model was checked and was also tested with the test dataset to make sure it worked as intended. The main purpose of this study was to help identify people at high risk for diabetes and support doctors in making better prevention and treatment decisions.
